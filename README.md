# Travel-Time-Minimizer-Frontend

## Description

This Project helps us to find the minimum time required to travel from one location to another with the contraint that only ONE FLIGHT PASS is allowed, i.e when one cannot afford more than one flight. 
It is **FULL STACK** PROJECT and it uses **Springboot** as backend and **Vue.js** in the frontend. It performs all the **CRUD operations** for different routes. Also, It displays all the routes in tabular format with **MODEL View** using dialogs in Vue.js.  
One can do, **UNIVERSAL SEARCH, MULTI-SEARCH, COMPOUND-SEARCH** for different routes. It uses **server-side pagination** for fast access to server requests. It supports **file upload**, CSV file containing routes.
It creates the shortest path graph and gives a pleasing **visualisation of the shortest path** to be taken to **minimize time with taking atmost one flight** using **vis.js** library.
